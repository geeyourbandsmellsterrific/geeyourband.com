  Gee, Your Band Smells Terrific, one of the best party bands (and best wedding band, best company party band, best festival band, etc.) in the Cincinnati area. We play the Super Hits of the 70s all original songs, unoriginal artists. We are the region’s only true 70s showcase band, covering all genres and hopelessly devoted to partying like it’s 1979! With all the polyester splendor and kitschy fun that made 1970-1979 the best decade ever. We are the premier cover band for getting down and boogying.
